## Question 2: "Is Streamlit okay to deploy?"

### ✅ **ANSWER: YES! Streamlit is PERFECT for this challenge!**

### Why Streamlit is the BEST Choice:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 🆓 **100% FREE** | No credit card, no costs |
| 🐙 **GitHub Integration** | Direct deployment from your repo |
| ⚡ **Easy Setup** | 3 clicks to deploy |
| 🔒 **Secrets Management** | Safe place for API keys |
| 🚀 **Auto-Deploy** | Updates automatically on git push |
| 🌐 **Public URL** | Get shareable link instantly |
| 📊 **Student-Friendly** | Designed for projects like yours |

### Deployment Steps (Super Simple):

1. **Create GitHub repo** → Push your code
2. **Go to share.streamlit.io** → Sign in with GitHub
3. **Click "New app"** → Select your repo
4. **Add API key in Secrets** → Done!

**Result:** You get a public URL like:
```
https://university-faq-manthan.streamlit.app/
```

### Alternative Options (NOT Recommended):

| Platform | Why NOT for You |
|----------|-----------------|
| Heroku | Requires payment now (no free tier) |
| AWS | Too complex for student project |
| Azure | Requires credit card, complex setup |
| GCP | Requires credit card, overkill |
| Railway | Limited free tier |

### ✅ Streamlit Cloud Perfect Because:

- ✅ Made for Python apps like yours
- ✅ Perfect for Streamlit projects (obviously!)
- ✅ Used by thousands of students
- ✅ No DevOps knowledge needed
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ No server management
- ✅ Scales automatically

## Question 3: "Do we need to put all files on GitHub?"

### ✅ **ANSWER: YES, almost all files (some excluded)**

### Files TO Push to GitHub ✅

```
✅ All Python files (.py)
✅ All documentation files (.md)
✅ requirements.txt
✅ setup.bat, setup.sh
✅ run_demo.bat
✅ .env.example (template)
✅ .gitignore
✅ backend/ folder (all files)
✅ frontend/ folder (all files)
✅ data/pdfs/ (sample documents)
✅ .streamlit/ folder (config)
```

### Files NOT to Push ❌

```
❌ .env (contains API key!)
❌ venv/ or env/ (virtual environment)
❌ __pycache__/ (Python cache)
❌ data/vector_db/ (generated files)
❌ *.pyc (compiled Python)
❌ .DS_Store (Mac files)
```

### Why It's Safe:

Your `.gitignore` file (already configured) prevents sensitive files from being pushed:

```gitignore
# Environment variables (contains API key)
.env

# Virtual environment
venv/
env/

# Vector database (generated, can be rebuilt)
data/vector_db/
```

### API Key Security:

1. **In Local Development:**
   - API key is in `.env` file
   - `.env` is in `.gitignore`
   - Never pushed to GitHub

2. **In Streamlit Cloud:**
   - API key added in "Secrets" section
   - Never visible in code
   - Secure and encrypted
